*pretty_args* pretty :Args commad	Last change: 04 August 2013

This pluginn provides just one command:
    
						    *:Args*
:Args[!] [mods] [newline]
:Args [newline]

	The [mods] is a |filename-modifier| used to modify the file names.
	The default is ":t" (which prints just the base name).  Except of
	standard |filename-modifier|s there are two additional ones:
						    *%:H* *%:S* *::H* *::S*
	    :H	prints basefile name together with its parent directory.  If
		combined with more :H.  If combined with more :H prints more
		directory components of the path.
	    :S	is using |pathshorten()| to shorten the path.
	Note that you can combine modifiers as usual, for example ":H:S" is
	a valid modifier.  It will print "d/pretty_args.txt" where ":H" would
	print "doc/pretty_args.txt".

						    *Args_fnamemodifier*
	The last used [mods] is remembered and it will be used next time,
	unless the bang "!" is used.  You can also specify the default
	modifier in |Args_fnamemodifier| variable.  If this is the
	case it will be used, instead of ":t" when |:Args| is run for the
	first time.

	|:Args| command is using |hl-Directory| group to highlight the current
	arg instead of [...] like |:arg| does.

	If [newline] argument is used the each arg is printed in a separate
	line.  [newline] can be anything except a string starting with ":"
	like modifiers do.  This is useful with the ":p" modifier.

Example: if you want to remove a common path from args, which is the case if
you work on a project which under "/home/user/project/" directory, you can use
the following path modifier: >
    :Args :p:s?^/home/user/project/??
<or even: >
    :Args :p:s?^/home/user/project/??:S
<
Another tip is useful if the path is long and you do not want to type it.
Then you can use ^r=expand('%:p:h:h...') in the command line.  Check |^r=| and
|%:p|, |%:h|.


There is one public function:
						    *Fnamemodify()*
Fnamemodify({fname}, {mods})
	It works like |fnamemodify()| but also handles the two
	additional modifiers ":H" and ":S".
